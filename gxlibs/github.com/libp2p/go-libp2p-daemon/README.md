> A standalone deployment of a libp2p host, running in its own OS process and installing a set of
  virtual endpoints to enable co-local applications to: communicate with peers, handle protocols,
  interact with the DHT, participate in pubsub, etc. no matter the language they are developed in,
  nor whether a native libp2p implementation exists in that language.
